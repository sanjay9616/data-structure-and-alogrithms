Searching is a technique to find a desired item within a collection of data. This collection of data can take various forms, such as arrays, lists, trees, or other structured representations.

Sorting is a process in which items are arranged systematically. It has two common yet distinct meanings: Ordering: arranging items in a sequence, ordered by some criterion. Categorizing: grouping items with similar properties.

A Queue Data Structure is a fundamental concept in computer science used for storing and managing data in a specific order. It follows the principle of “First in, First out” (FIFO), where the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. Queues are commonly used in various algorithms and applications for their simplicity and efficiency in managing data flow.
