<h2><a href="https://github.com/sanjay9616/data-structure-and-alogrithms/blob/master/Searching/README.md">Searching</a></h2>

Searching is a technique to find a desired item within a collection of data. This collection of data can take various forms, such as arrays, lists, trees, or other structured representations.

<h2><a href="https://github.com/sanjay9616/data-structure-and-alogrithms/blob/master/Sorting/README.md">Sorting</a></h2>

Sorting is a process in which items are arranged systematically. It has two common yet distinct meanings: Ordering: arranging items in a sequence, ordered by some criterion. Categorizing: grouping items with similar properties.

<h2><a href="https://github.com/sanjay9616/data-structure-and-alogrithms/blob/master/Stack/README.md">Stack</a></h2>

Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out). LIFO implies that the element that is inserted last, comes out first and FILO implies that the element that is inserted first, comes out last.

<h2><a href="https://github.com/sanjay9616/data-structure-and-alogrithms/blob/master/Queue/README.md">Queue</a></h2>

A Queue Data Structure is a fundamental concept in computer science used for storing and managing data in a specific order. It follows the principle of “First in, First out” (FIFO), where the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. Queues are commonly used in various algorithms and applications for their simplicity and efficiency in managing data flow.

<h2><a href="https://github.com/sanjay9616/data-structure-and-alogrithms/blob/master/Heap/README.md">Heap</a></h2>

A Heap is a complete binary tree data structure that satisfies the heap property: for every node, the value of its children is less than or equal to its own value. Heaps are often used to implement priority queues, where the smallest (or largest) element is always at the root of the tree.

<h2><a href="https://github.com/sanjay9616/data-structure-and-alogrithms/blob/master/Linked%20List/README.md">Linked List</a></h2>
A linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science. It consists of nodes where each node contains data and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence. This allows for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion operations compared to arrays.
