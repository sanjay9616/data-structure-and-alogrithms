<h2>Sorting</h2>

Sorting is a process in which items are arranged systematically. It has two common yet distinct meanings: Ordering: arranging items in a sequence, ordered by some criterion. Categorizing: grouping items with similar properties.

Below are some search algorithms and their time complexity and space complexity:
