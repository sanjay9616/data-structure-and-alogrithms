<h2>Sorting</h2>

Sorting is a process in which items are arranged systematically. It has two common yet distinct meanings: Ordering: arranging items in a sequence, ordered by some criterion. Categorizing: grouping items with similar properties.

Below are some search algorithms and their time complexity and space complexity:

<h2><a href="https://github.com/sanjay9616/data-structure-and-alogrithms/blob/master/Sorting/Bubble%20sort/README.md">Bubble Sort</a></h2>

Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high.

<h2><a href="https://github.com/sanjay9616/data-structure-and-alogrithms/blob/master/Sorting/Selection%20sort/README.md">Selection Sort</a></h2>

Selection sort is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the list.

<h2><a href="https://github.com/sanjay9616/data-structure-and-alogrithms/blob/master/Sorting/Merge%20sort/README.md">Merge Sort</a></h2>

Merge sort is defined as a sorting algorithm that works by dividing an array into smaller subarrays, sorting each subarray, and then merging the sorted subarrays back together to form the final sorted array.

In simple terms, we can say that the process of merge sort is to divide the array into two halves, sort each half, and then merge the sorted halves back together. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.
