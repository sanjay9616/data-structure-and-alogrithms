<h2>Sorting</h2>

Searching is a technique to find a desired item within a collection of data. This collection of data can take various forms, such as arrays, lists, trees, or other structured representations.

Below are some search algorithms and their time complexity and space complexity:

| Algorithm                                                                                                                     | Best | Average | Worst | Space Complexity |
