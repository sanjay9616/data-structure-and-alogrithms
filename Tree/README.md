**Tree:**

A tree data structure is a hierarchical structure that is used to represent and organize data in a way that is easy to navigate and search. It is a collection of nodes that are connected by edges and has a hierarchical relationship between the nodes.

The topmost node of the tree is called the root, and the nodes below it are called the child nodes. Each node can have multiple child nodes, and these child nodes can also have their own child nodes, forming a recursive structure.

<h2>Binary tree:</h2>

A binary Tree is defined as a Tree data structure with at most 2 children, usually distinguished as ‚Äúleft‚Äù, and ‚Äúright‚Äù.

**Types of Binary Tree:**

- Binary Tree consists of following types based on the  number of children: </br>
    1. **Full Binary Tree** - binary tree with either zero or two child nodes for each node. </br>
    2. **Degenerate Binary Tree** - Every non-leaf node has just one child. </br>

- On the basis of completion of levels, the binary tree can be divided into following types: </br>
    1. **Complete Binary Tree** - all the levels of the tree are filled completely except the lowest level nodes which are filled from as left as possible </br>

    2. **Perfect Binary Tree** - all the leaf nodes are at the same depth, and all non-leaf nodes have two children </br>

    3. **Balanced Binary Tree** - which the height of the left subtree and right subtree of any node does not differ by more than 1 </br>

<h2>Ternary Tree:</h2>

A Ternary Tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most three child nodes, usually distinguished as ‚Äúleft‚Äù, ‚Äúmid‚Äù and ‚Äúright‚Äù.

<h2>N-ary Tree or Generic Tree:</h2>

Generic trees are a collection of nodes where each node is a data structure that consists of records and a list of references to its children(duplicate references are not allowed). Unlike the linked list, each node stores the address of multiple nodes.

**Special Types of Trees in Data Structure based on the nodes values:**

1. Binary Search Tree </br>
2. AVL Tree </br>
3. Red-Black Tree </br>
4. B-Tree </br>
5. B+ Tree </br>
6. Segment Tree </br>
